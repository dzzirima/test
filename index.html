          The relationship between Google and Wikipedia was originally
          collaborative in Wikipedia's early days, when Google helped reduce the
          pagerank of widespread uneditable Wikipedia clones that were simply ad
          farms. In 2007, Google introduced Knol, a direct competitor for
          community-driven encyclopedia creation.
